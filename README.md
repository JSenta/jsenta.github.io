### Welcome to my GitHub

As a PhD candidate in cognitive neuroscience, I study the computational processes underlying decision-making and learning. In particular, I am interested in how individual differences in psychiatric symptomatology relate to differences/abnormalities in these cognitive processes. I primarily make use of choice and classification models, reinforcement learning models, drift diffusion process models, and recurrent neural networks in my research. I use hierarchical Bayesian fitting methods to assess behavioral models, and investigate neural correlates of behavioral/compuational processes.

Prior to my graduate studies, I received a bachelor's degree in Mathematics and obtained my Fellowship in the Society of Actuaries, working as a consulting actuary for government-sponsored pension plans, and as a manager/consultant for private equity mergers and acquisitions.
