### Welcome to my GitHub
As a postdoctoral scholar at the Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, I am currently investigating the interplay of prefrontal executive control processes with reinforcement learning systems of the brain. In particular, I am exploring the relationship of psychiatric dimensions with impairments in learning and executive control by jointly modeling the interactive process space. 

During my Ph.D. work in Cognitive Neuroscience (at UC Berkeley), I focused on the computational processes underlying decision-making and learning. In particular, I investigated effortful decision-making and subjective value paradigms, decision-making under second-order uncertainty and inference across missing information, and learning under paradigms of contingency volatility. I employed a range of computational modeling approaches in my investigations, including hierarchical Bayesian inference, machine learning, and dimensionality reduction modeling.

Prior to my graduate studies, I received a bachelor's degree in Mathematics and obtained my Fellowship in the Society of Actuaries, working as a consulting actuary for government-sponsored pension plans and as a manager/consultant for private equity mergers and acquisitions.
